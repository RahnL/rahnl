While we were in Peru, we talked to several people about where to get quality goods at a good price. They all said "go to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinchero_District">Chinchero</a>."

On Sunday, the day we were heading to the area, we asked our guide, Alvero, if he thought the market at Chinchero was a good idea.  He suggested that, besides the market, we go to a cooperative of weavers.  And that's how we ended up at the Association of Woman Weavers of Chinchero, <a href="http://www.awanawasi.com/en/">Awana Wasi Tocapo</a>.

Upon arriving, we were given a demonstration of how alpaca hair is transformed into beautiful textiles.  Below are some of the highlights.  (Click on the picture to bring up bigger versions)

A demonstration on how to make the alpaca hair into yarn by twirling it on a spindle.  It takes several hours to make a each ball of yarn shown below.

The red yarn is made by grinding up a type of bug.

Different shades are made by adding salts to the dye, which makes it lighter.

Blue is made by combining 3 different roots and boiling it for 21 days.

Some people drive a hard bargain. These kids made some bracelets.
