<a title="Coke street vendor on street in Lima by BigRahn, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bigrahn/9021917998/"><img class="alignright" alt="Coke street vendor on street in Lima" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3782/9021917998_9d3c1b3aae_n.jpg" width="320" height="188" /></a>For years, I've been living vicariously through my friends who travel around the world. They go to exotic far-off places and return with pictures and tales of grand adventures.

Sometimes, they even send a postcard. It's always fun to bet on how long it will take to get to the recipient here in the US. (The post cards we sent home during our recent trip to Peru took between 3 and 4 weeks.)

The stories, pictures and postcards are appreciated, and I always enjoy them. But sometimes, they bring back a little something more for me - something they know I will love. They bring me a bottle or can of Coca-Cola from wherever they visited.

Yup, good ol' Coca-Cola from around the world.

For years, I have talked about taking pictures of each bottle and can, writing down its story, and creating an online catalog to share.  This year, I finally made the leap from thinking about it to doing it.

On Gone Somewhere, I share stories of my adventures. On <a href="http://myworldofcoke.com">My World of Coke</a>, the stories are about places my friends and family (and sometimes I) have been.

<a href="http://myworldofcoke.com">My World of Coke</a> is great for anyone who loves a Coca-Cola collectible and a good story. I hope to see you there.
