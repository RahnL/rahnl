Knowing that you, my loyal readers, all appreciate that I appreciate a good donut, I feel obliged to share a couple of pictures.

While contemplating what to order, we both got a kick from the menu because not only could we get our sugar fix, but we could get lottery tickets. Of course, we got both.

Last time I was here, probably 30 years ago, they had a doughnut that was bigger than my head. Or at least it felt that way. So naturally, I wanted to see if that was still the case. I happy asked if they had any, and I got the last one for the day.

Is my head bigger or the donut smaller?

Here's a peek into the donut kitchen I took while we were waiting for our order.  You'll be happy to know, they had an "A" on their health score.

You can't quite see it in the picture, but all those donuts were glistening from their glaze.
