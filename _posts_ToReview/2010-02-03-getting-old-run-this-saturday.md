I'm planning on a long, slow, really boring run Saturday to celebrate getting old. 

Plan is to do the lake loop at Little Mulberry Park, Hog Mountain Entrance, starting at 7:30, going for 8 hours or 41 miles, whichever comes first. I'll be going slow, as usual.  (Figuring 2 laps per hour in the second half, if that fast.)

Please feel free to join me for all or some of it.  Since I'll be going around the lake, either direction will find me. (And I plan on changing direction every couple of laps.)  I'll be wearing either my bright yellow vest or the orange (rust) one that looks like fleece.

I plan on having having minimal aid in the car. (Water and pretzels.  Maybe something else if I think of it.  Feel free to bring something.)

Why the loop route?  It's relatively flat, but big enough to not be horribly boring.  And I need to get some time on concrete to get my legs ready for ING.

Heck, I'll probably be posting updates to facebook during the run, just cause it's kinda fun to do.
