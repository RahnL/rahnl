Ah, last night started with good intentions. Headed to bed early, planned to sleep in a little bit, then head out for a run. Come 4:30 though, I was awake. But it's not as bad as it seems, since I was woken up by a big thunderstorm. I was awake enough to decide to grab my camera and see what I get lucky with.

So, 4 minutes later, standing on the front porch in my pajamas, I start shooting. Hmmm...it's mainly whats called Cloud-to-Cloud lightning, which gives nice light and a lot of thunder, but not a whole lot to take pictures of. After about an hour, as I was starting to get a little bored, one bolt shot right over my head, with the thunder following immediately. (And as the pros say, it sufficiently <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">scared the crap out of me</span> made me jump.)

After being sufficiently awakened by that, I did manage to get two shots in:

Now, for those people interested in such things, here's how I do this.

It's important to have a tripod. And a camera that can be set in "bulb" mode, where you can hold the shutter open as long as you want, or a "time" mode, where you can tell it how long to stay open. A cable release is helpful.

Set up the camera, plug your cable in, and grab a chair. I generally start with short exposures, and build up to longer as I see how each exposure comes out. In the middle of the night, if the street lamps are out, I've done 15-20 seconds. The shot on the left is a 9 second exposure, and 11 seconds. (Of course, I'm holding it open, then once I see the lightning, I release the shutter so it closes.)

I generally step the shutter down a couple stops to help block out extra ambient like. I suppose a filter would probably help with this, but I don't have the appropriate one.

(I should probably note that I'm sitting on my front porch, which is covered. That's important so I don't get soaked if it's raining, and I have some sort of protection from the lightning.)

Well, now that the sky is clear, I should probably for that run. But heading back to bed is looking pretty good too...
