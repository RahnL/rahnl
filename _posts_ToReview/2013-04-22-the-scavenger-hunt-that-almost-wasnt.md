We love scavenger hunts, treasure hunts, geocaching, and just generally looking for random stuff. Always have, always will. They're a fun activity for the whole family, and when you're on vacation somewhere new, it provides a great opportunity to get to know the local area.

We were recently at the <a href="http://www.watercolorresort.com/">WaterColor Inn &amp; Resort</a> in Santa Rosa Beach, Florida for a get-away with a number of people from work. One item on the event agenda was a scavenger hunt. Naturally, we signed up for this and eagerly waited for it to start.

Unfortunately, due to inclement weather, the event organizers decided to cancel it. Because we don't worry too much about melting in the rain, we arranged to get the clue list, and do it anyhow, just for fun.

Tom H and his wife Stephanie didn't get the email that it had been cancelled, and showed up to do it, too.  Since it was only the four of us, we teamed up and did it all together.

Being the highly-skilled, finely-tuned scavenger hunting machines we all are, our first stop was the hotel bar to enjoy something to eat and drink while we pondered the clues. With a dessert, a couple of drinks, four cell phones, and random staff assisting, we had answers to most of the trivia questions and a plan of action within 1 1/2 hours.

My favorite trivia question was answered by our server at the bar: "What ingredients make up WaterColor's signature mojito?"  The answer: Mint, soda, simple syrup, rum, 1/2 lime freshly squeezed.

On the way out of the inn, we stopped by the front desk to get some clarification on a couple of questions, and the folks working there were a treasure trove of information, answering just about every question in the hunt's list.  The man working there grew up in the area, and knew just about everything there was to know...he was a trivia savant!  Did you know The Truman Show was filmed in Seaside, Florida?

The photo ops were fun, especially since the weather sent a lot of people home, so there wasn't always someone available to take our picture.  Here are some of the highlights:

Our "strangers" foot was cut off in the picture, but she did have on her flip flops.[/caption]

We couldn't get to the dock because a tent was put up in front of the entrance, so it's in the background. We also were shooting for our creativity bonus picture by using sign language.[/caption]

It was great fun, and we were still laughing about it that night at a reception dinner.  By then, the stories weren't really being exaggerated at all.  Of course we <em>really</em> did get run off the road by the locals AND chased by alligators while trying to swim across the lake to find the frogs...
