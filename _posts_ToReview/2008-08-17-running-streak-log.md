Welcome to my exercise log.

The current Excel version can be found <a href="http://gonesomewhere.com/rahnexerciselog2009.xlsx">here</a>.

<strong>8/30/09 Update:</strong> Here is the previous <a href="http://www.gonesomewhere.com/RahnsRunLog-2009.xls">2009 log</a>. I started over, since I had a long break, and I wanted to simplify the log to allow it to be used for some other things.

<strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Old Stuff:</span></em></strong>

On August 4th, 2008, I started a running streak.  I'm running and/or walking everyday until I hit the goal I've set for myself. (Or I break a leg.) My first discussion about this is <a href="http://www.gonesomewhere.com/?p=155">here</a>, and I'll occassionally through posts up on the blog about this. <strong> [NOTE: The streak ended on 11/10/08]</strong>

Below is the latest log info for my logging. This will be changed and updated as I go along.  To be honest, it will mostly be out of date, since I won't update it everyday.  Online, I'm using <a href="http://www.runnerplus.com/people/beerrahn">RunnerPlus.com</a> to track my mileage, it will be be the most current. (Although it may still be off by a day or two, since I don't synchonize my toys every day.)

(Note: Thanks to <a href="http://www.davidhays.net/running/runlog/runlog.html">David Hays</a> for making his log template available.<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> I may create my own at some point, but for now, this works well</span>.)

<strong>2/1/09 Update:</strong> I'm amazed how popular this page is. It's continually showing up in the stats as being shown regularly.  The 2008 spreadsheet is <a href="http://www.gonesomewhere.com/RahnsRunLog-2008.xls">here</a>.
