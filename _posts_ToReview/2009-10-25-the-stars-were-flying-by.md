Last Wednesday, we took  a break from the ordinary and woke up way before the crack of dawn to watch the <a href="http://meteorshowersonline.com/orionids.html">Orionids</a> meteor shower.

Dianna had seen in the park schedule that they were hosting a meteor shower party at Little Mulberry.  Yes, the same park I always go running at.  So, being the adventurous type, we committed to waking up at 4:00 AM in order to be there around 5.  (Thats when the party started and the forecast said the viewing would be best.)

The morning was brisk, in the low 40's, and the night cloudless. Getting there, the park staff was setting up, and we packed up our lawn chairs and headed up to the West meadow to watch.  Originally we were going to take blankets to sit on, but at the last minute decided to take some reclining lawn chairs. Good move!  An we brought our trusty <a href="https://www.getsnuggie.com/flare/next">snuggies</a> too.

Settling in, we sat back and stared at the sky.  I took some pictures, but didn't catch any meteors in them.

An hour and a half later, we decided to pack it up and head down to the shelter where the park provided pastries and coffee.  Only 4 of the 9 people who preregistered showed up, so there was more than enough food.

Meteor count:  We both saw 15.  We think we may have actually seen more, but there were a number we saw in our peripheral vision, or they were so faint we couldn't be sure.

We think we'll start making this a yearly event.
