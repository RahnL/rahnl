Today marks the beginning of the 4th month of my running streak.  For those of you who didn't quite catch it, that means I've run at least 1 mile everyday for the last 3 months.  Holy cow.

That's a lot of running, and for the most part, it's been a good time.  My buddy Left Knee hasn't been complaining too much.  However, Right Hip has been whining. I should probably go see a doctor sometime soon.  (I think it's just muscle related, but never hurts to get an opinion.)

And for those who care about such things, upcoming plans:

 - December 7th:  Braselton 8K. I'm going to try to shave a few minutes off this nice 5 mile course.

 - January 4th:  GUTS FA50K.  Easier course than what I attempted in October.

 - February 16:  Black Warrior 50K over in Alabama.  A group of us are heading over for this.

 - March 29th:  ING Georgia marathon.

That's going to be a busy 3 months.

Now, for those of you still reading, stop reading now and go vote.
