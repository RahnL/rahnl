<p>It's official. The 2 month weight loss challenge at work ended yesterday.</p><p>Today, the winner was announced.  It was close between the top three...but I pulled the lead with a loss of 14 pounds for the win!  WooHoo.</p><p>My co-worker and I have decided to continue the challenge through the rest of the year. Of course, after losing weight, a huge challenge is keeping it off, and that's what we really want to do.  Ah, this should be fun (even though there won't be a winners purse for this challenge.)</p><p>Today, someone asked how I did it. Well, that is, what was the work involved besides bringing in cake, cookies, scones, and brownies for everyone else. :)</p><p>The answer is pretty simple.  I increased the intensity of my workouts. (Instead of running 11-12 minute miles, I bumped it up to 9 minutes.  Sure, I couldn't keep it up for more than a couple miles, but it did great for my heart.) And I reduced how much I ate most the time.  (Not all the time, just most of the time.)  And we switched to eating a lot more fruits and vegetables.</p><p>Pretty simple.</p>
