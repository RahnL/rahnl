This morning, <a href="http://www.runnersfit.com">Runners Fit</a> had their New Balance reps (Matt and Karen(?)) in the store for a "Train in Them" session. This is an opportunity to try on some of the new models and shoes, and take them out for a test run. Most of the rest of this post will be a review of the shoes. If this doesn't interest you, I won't take it personally. However, if you're dying to know what I think about when I'm trying shoes (and who wouldn't be), then this is for you.

This morning, they were showing us the <a href="http://www.newbalance.com/products/MR1063/">MR1063</a> and the <a href="http://www.newbalance.com/running/training/MR769/">MR769</a>., some of their models built on their new performance last. This was a good chance for me to try them, since I think it's been at least 15 years since I ran in NB's, probably longer.

I'm a neutral runner with a mid-foot strike. Years ago, I did the tradition heel to toe, and I needed a super stability shoe. It took a long time, but I learned a midfoot to forefoot strike, and I've been a lot happier with it. Unfortunately, I have a wider than normal foot, and they didn't have my size in the 1063 (the neutral shoe), so I tried out the 769.

Now, first impressions:
<ul>
	<li>They looked good for road shoes. My personal preference is for loud, like you find on trail shoes. They have the fancy laces that are harder to come undone.</li>
	<li>The 1063's I tried on had a tighter toebox than the 769's. (This is why I needed the wider size.) They were a little tight across the bottom of the laces (the toe side). Loosening the laces didn't help much, but again, as stated, with a wider size I would have been fine.</li>
	<li>The 769's had a very roomy toebox, and no tighteness across the laces. For long runs, this will be real nice. (For your 5-10K's, tighter isn't such a big deal since your feet don't swell as much.) However, there was a little slippage in the heel. Alternate lacing to a farther back hole fixed that right up, making this comfortable to put on.</li>
	<li>The base was wide! Huh, you ask? This is what I love about my current brand shoes, the sole of the foot is wider than the uppers. When you stand in a shoe, your foot shouldn't overhang on the sides so you can't see the edge of the sole. These didn't disappoint, and they provided a very solid platform. (Keep in mind that I'm well north of 200 lbs. so I know what a solid platform means.)</li>
</ul>

Now, I'm a firm believer in that a good shoe shouldn't need to be broken in. (They should fit comfortably within 1 run under 5 miles.) Maybe that's a tough, but from paying the big money for shoes, that's what I expect. These shoes did pretty good on this point. My run was 4.5 miles, and by the time I finished, they felt pretty good.  Below is what I noticed during the run:
<ul>
	<li>The midfoot and toe was comfortable. They had just enough cushion to feel soft and absorb the road.</li>
	<li>The heel was much stiffer and more firm than I was expecting. I was hoping for just a little bit of cushion, but nope, there wasn't much give in them.</li>
	<li>The stability is probably really good. I felt like I was running  on the outer edge of my feet, which if I was a pronator, would probably hit the spot.</li>
	<li>The heel-to-toe ratio was good for running. However, I found the heel a little bit high for walking.  It wasn't horrible, I'd probably get used to it after a few more miles. (I may not have noticed it if there was more cushion in the heel.)</li>
	<li>It was pouring rain this morning about a half hour before we headed out. The traction on these were good, and I didn't feel slippery on the road at all.</li>
	<li>Since these were demo shoes, I avoided the puddles, so I can't talk about how water repellant they are. :)</li>
</ul>
After the run, the reps gave us some door prizes; a hand towel, bottle opener, and some candy.  Being Valentine day, at least one guy among us took some extra for his sweetie.

They also had a drawing for a free pair of shoes. No, I didn't win, but hey, I had a good time.

Note: I have no financial interest in New Balance. I offered to give them a video review, but it was too noisy with everyone there, so didn't get a chance. I was going to film one later, but since I didn't have an actual shoe to hold up, and figured this was better. And for the record, I actually know what a shoe last is, and how it's used in the shoe making process.
