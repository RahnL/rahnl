For those of you who don't know, I was out for the last 4 days crewing a team for the <a href="http://www.blueridgerelay.com">Blue Ridge Relay</a>. We had a blast, and I'll have several posts over the next week talking about it. There will be plenty of pictures too.

Don't worry, the running streak is intact. For some reason, the team failed to show up for my planned group run on Friday morning, so I got a mile in by myself.  It involved going a 1/4 of a mile down the driveway and back, then doing a 1/2 mile worth of sprints in the backyard (that was a couple hundred feet long.)

Saturday, originally I was going to count the miles I did during crewing as my mile. Although I have no idea how far I actually ran, it was easily over a mile. (There was a lot of running a 1/4 mile down the road to either point the direction or give the signal we had someone coming in.)  Lifting the ice chests out of the van about a 100 times should count for something too.  But turns out I was able to get an official mile and a half in, but I'll save the explanation for the main story.
