For a fun morning, little Max and I headed over to the <a href="http://www.lawrencevillefarmersmarket.com/">Lawrenceville Farmers Market</a> to see what we could find.
We've been to the market in Suwanee a number of times, and it's been pretty good to us, but it's a bit of a drive.

If you're looking for it, the city made the decision to move the market back to the city square. It's in the lot next to the parking structure, between old city hall and the post office. Because of the parking structure, there is tons of parking. While you can't quite tell from the picture, there was a good turn-out of people, and quite a few vendors.

We went to the old location about a month ago, and talked to Ann and Frank from Victory Bakers about their "butter roll". (It's really a rugelach, but most people down in the South don't know what that is.) When we walked up this time, they remembered who we were, and even that last time we had both kids. After piling us with samples, we got some gingerbread and crystallized ginger biscotti. Be sure to stop by and chat with them.

We bought some tomatoes and cinnamon cucumbers from another vendor. I don't know what they are, but figured it was worth trying. She said they were like apple rings, but I'm not sure what that means exactly...

I also talked to a basket maker. He's the third generation basket maker in his family, and his kids and grandchildren know how to make them too. Â He really likes to fish, so be sure to bring that up if you stop by his booth.

We bought some potatoes from Tim, of Franklin Farms. His family has been farming their land since 1895! I enjoyed talking to Tim, and he told me about his growing practices. They are something like "plow the ground, put the seeds in with fertilizer, and then hope for rain." This year in particular, he's been doing a whole lot of the hoping for rain.

Besides the potatoes we bought from Tim, we had to get an eggplant. I'm not sure what we're going to do with it, but given that it's the size of Max's head, I couldn't resist. Check that thing out!

We got some bagels and talked to the folks from <a href="http://www.facebook.com/TweedysBagels">Tweedy's</a>. It's a new breakfast and bagel place off Sugarloaf. I think we need more good breakfast joints around here, since we get tired of just Waffle House.

Among the other vendors were folks offering Italian ice, a coffee roaster, other farmers, a soap maker, a wood worker, and one of my other favorites, a <a href="http://facebook.com/grilledbread">grilled sandwich maker</a>. Not, not a panini maker, but real grilled sandwiches. They take the ingredients and put it on the dough, smush it together, and throw it on a grill. Yum.

We went to the lady with gelato and sorbet. She makes these wonderful frozen treats, and we had to get some. This week, she had green apple, which was both sweet and tart. It was great!

Oooooohhh...[/caption]

We also picked up some bread from <a href="http://www.freshlymilledbreads.com/">Freshly Milled Breads</a>. He was friendly, and is part of the <a href="http://gwinnett.locallygrown.net/welcome">Gwinnett Locally Grown online market</a>. If anyone wants to order online or ahead of time, he could easily bring the food here instead of the Tuesday pickup. (Note I haven't tried the online market, I just found out about it.)

We had a good time. Head on over there, and let us know what you thought. And if anyone knows what to do with an eggplant...
