In a departure from my usual insightful and intellectual dialogue, today I'm going to share a story.

The other day, I was sitting on a bench watching a squirrel. He ran up a big tree and across a branch that was about 30 feet in the air. He got to the end of the sturdy branch, paused then backed off.  He walked a couple of feet back down the branch, looking as though he was having an internal debate on whether to jump across to the next tree.  Those branches looked mighty flimsy. But, after a brief pause, he turned around, ran across the branch, leaped, grabbed desperately, hung on, and scrambled across to continue his daily squirrel duties.

<span>I suppose that watching this happen should have inspired a great epiphany about the meaning of life.  It didn't - and that isn't the story I wanted to share with you.</span>

<span>The story I do want share happened about a week ago. </span>

<span>I've been vanpooling to work for about a year and a half. Our van has a lot of fun. Because we are such a happy and fun-loving group, the organization that runs the vanpool, <a href="http://batma.org/">BATMA</a>, occassionally asks us for things.  For example, one time last year, they wanted to give some local execs a ride around Buckhead, so they borrowed our van to do it.  Once, they wanted a picture of a vanpool group for some publicity, so we all dutifully posed and had our faces posted in some newsletter.</span>

<span>The most exciting favor happened more recently. We were contacted by <a href="http://batma.org/">BATMA</a> about having a news reporter ride along. After some discussions between our primary driver and their publicist, it was arranged.  Chris the Commuter Dude, from <a href="http://www.11alive.com/">11Alive</a>, would ride into town with us one morning, ask us questions and maybe put a story together.</span>

<span>This morning, the results of that morning were aired for all of Atlanta to see. And, through the marvels of the internet, you can watch it too.</span>

<span>Now, having written this much, I'm not actually going to tell you the story. After all, that's the reporters job. You can read all about it <a href="http://11aliveblogs.com/commuterdude/?p=366">here</a>.</span>

<span>The video is <a href="http://www.11alive.com/video?maven_playerId=immersiveplayer2&amp;maven_referralObject=1058736148">here</a>. Yup, that's me in the first second and a half. Apparently nothing else I said was worth repeating (big surprise there).</span>

<span>I did come prepared that day, I had my own camera to film the filmers:</span>
<object width="425" height="344" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/K8eFMLXtLvQ&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/K8eFMLXtLvQ&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /></object>

In summary, I like taking a vanpool. It makes commuting a positive experience (when I don't just sleep the whole way, as I often do.)
