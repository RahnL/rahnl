This morning I headed down to the expo for the 2008 ING Georgia marathon at the Georgia Dome. (The location was changed last week after a tornado hit the original venue.) Getting there by train is no problem, and probably a lot easier than driving.I headed down relatively early, since there were some speakers at 11:00 AM and 12:00 PM I wanted to see.

Packet pickup was near empty when I got there, which made it pretty quick. One interesting they did was have shirt pickup on the opposite side of the expo. I don't know if this was a move by the marketing department or just an arrangement of coincidence due to the last minute changes. I almost ended up with the wrong shirt since I didn't see the section for the full until the guy was handing me a shirt for the half. We got it all straightened out. The logo is pretty cool...it's a bunch of runners legs, but the outline is building in the Atlanta skyline.

After wandering around a bit, I went to the first speaker I was interested in, Kathrine Switzer. She was the first woman to run the Boston Marathon and broke the sport open for woman. Yay for girl-power! She was a real good speaker and also told about how she started organizing races and eventually partnered with Avon and started the first of their marathons. (31 years ago tomorrow, in Atlanta). She was also the major influence in getting the womens marathon put into the Olympics. (First run in Los Angeles in 1984, the first Olympic games that I really remember. I even went to an event.)

I bought a copy of her book, and she was kind enough to autograph it and pose for a picture.

The second person I wanted to see was Helen Klein, who is 85 this year. She started running when she was 55 and has completed over a 100 marathons and even more ultras. I didn't know this going in, but she also participated in an ECO challenge, which is truly amazing for anyone. The majority of her presentation was actually a clip of Dateline where they were talking about her doing it. I think she was 72 at the time. I thought her talk was good...she was just the cutest little ol' lady (who will blow my running away). Her husband was there also there, and from hearing her talk, her running is all his fault. (He signed them up for her first 10<a title="Helen Klein" href="http://bigrahn.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/helen-klein.jpg"><img src="http://bigrahn.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/helen-klein.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Helen Klein" align="right" /></a> miler.) Her slogan is "I'd rather wear out than rust," and she's doing just that.

I also listened to a lecture on sports nutrition. There was some good information there, much of which I knew already, and some new stuff. Because a friend had recommended I do a sweat/hydration profile a few weeks ago, I was interested in how this stuff compared to that.

After the speeches, I hit a number of the booths. Bought some gloves so I'm ready next winter, and a small fanny pack that I think will work out well. It has an elastic band, so I won't need to cinch it quite as tight to get it to stay in place, which is a problem I've had with other ones in the past. Testing it at home, it holds 5 gels and my license and keys, so it's about the right size.

Time to go relax after our pasta dinner, <strong><em>for tomorrow we run</em></strong>.
