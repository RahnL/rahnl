What would you build if you had access to a shop and tools?  I have my list:
<ul>
	<li>Do some wood work</li>
	<li>Try screen printing</li>
	<li>Make something that spins and moves.</li>
	<li>Do some electronics something or another</li>
	<li>Melt metal and do some blacksmithing</li>
	<li>Maybe make a tesla coil or some other cool thing for Halloween</li>
</ul>
This list goes on.  I can dream up things all night long. Heck, I often do.  Usually it involves software and computers, because that's what I have access to, but for years I've dreamed of having access to more. It's been a good dream, except every morning I woke up to my Leatherman, a Dremel and a garage filled with things that weren't making cool things.

But guess what?  The dream is over.  It's happened!

There's a brand new place in town, <a href="http://geekspacegwinnett.org/">Geekspace Gwinnett</a>.  It's what's called a makerspace, where people come together to, well, make things. Be social, share ideas, get help, and hangout, but overall, it's people wanting to make things.  Yeah, that's cool!

Here are some pictures of the MIG welding class I just took here.

Come on down and share your ideas, there's an open house every Tuesday night.

What do you want to make?
