I was talking to some friends and co-workers not long ago, and we were discussing diet, exercise, eating, and all that good stuff. I promised to write something up about what I was doing, with a bit more detail than I put into my previous <a href="http://gonesomewhere.com/2012/07/eating-vegetables-diet-update-flexitarian/">post</a>.

With nary a care in the world, I sat down and before I knew it, I had over a thousand words<a href="http://gonesomewhere.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Red-Peppers-small.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-1164" title="Red Peppers - small" src="http://gonesomewhere.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Red-Peppers-small-150x133.jpg" alt="Red peppers" width="150" height="133" /></a> written, and had barely even started talking about what I was interested in talking about. (I'm not kidding. Here is the first <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jJh_NZ2Q5ElxwlkGuSLxLMcaIQmbIyrD_ntepAvqYRA/edit">draft</a>, just for giggles.) Realizing that it had more of a book feel to it, I decided to shelve it for later, and just do a good ol' blog post.

So, starting over and being a bit more concise:

I am following a whole food, (mostly) plant based diet based on the writings and lectures of doctors <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1583333002/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1583333002&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=gonesome-20">Esselstyn</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=gonesome-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1583333002" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" />, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1932100660/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1932100660&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=gonesome-20">Campbell</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=gonesome-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1932100660" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" />, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1570671974/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1570671974&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=gonesome-20">Lisle</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=gonesome-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1570671974" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" />, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005ZI32H0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005ZI32H0&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=gonesome-20">McDougall</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=gonesome-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B005ZI32H0" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" /> and others, such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143114964/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0143114964&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=gonesome-20">Michael Pollan</a>.  Whew, that's a mouthful, and what's the proper pluralized form of doctor when it includes MD's and PhD's?

What they promote can be summarized [by me] as:
<ol>
	<li><em>Eat whole foods</em>. That is, foods that have ingredients you can recognize as being food. If it sounds Greek, with all sorts of prefixes and suffixes, then it's probably bad for you.</li>
	<li><em>Stay away from animal products</em>. This means stay away from meat. And from products made from meat. No hamburgers, hotdogs, or chicken soup. Oh, and for those of you confused, Fish is a meat. And eggs come from an animal, hence, they are meat[-ish].</li>
	<li><em>Stay away from dairy.</em> From what I've read, the good doctors don't quite say the same reasons for staying away from dairy, but they all agree you should. No milk, ice cream, coffee creamer and cheese.</li>
	<li><em>Stay away from food that's processed.</em> This is the stuff that's been beaten up, mixed up, pulverized, re-constituted, and then put back together. Er, stuff like all purpose flour.  (Whole wheat flour is fine. Stone ground is even better.)</li>
	<li><em>Don't pig out</em>.  Yeah, that's right, stop eating before you're stuffed to the gills.</li>
</ol>
So, what does that leave you with?  A whole lot, actually...
<ol>
	<li>Leafy greens: Lettuce, Spinach, Kale, Collard Greens, whatever you like.</li>
	<li>Beans: They're good for you're heart, the more you eat the more...uh, well, they're good for your heart.</li>
	<li>Oatmeal:  Eat a bowl every day. Really.  Put honey in it. Put raisins in it. Put apples and bananas in it...heck, pour your coffee and herbal tea into it if you want, but eat it.</li>
	<li>Fruit: Apples, bananas, grapes, strawberries, blueberries, and whatever other weird thing you can find in the produce aisle. Pretty much, anything in the produce aisle is allowed.</li>
	<li>Nuts, and related nut butters:  Here again is a disagreement amongst the doctors. I chose to eat in moderation.</li>
	<li>Just about any vegetable.</li>
	<li>A whole lot more.  The world's your (vegetarian, non-meat) oyster.</li>
</ol>
If I were starting from scratch, with just the above guidelines to go on, I'd eliminate things in the following order:  Milk, Oil, Meat.

That is, if I were to say, I'm going to take my first step, so what would I get rid of first, it would be milk products. Then, in a week or two, I'd get rid of all extra oil. Lastly, I'd get rid of the meat.

Now, I'm sure a lot of people will read that and say "No!  You need to do it all immediately!" Sorry guys, I disagree. It would help to do that, and it's completely doable. Heck, I did it, and I was a cookie and donut loving carnivore.  But for those people who don't want to commit whole-hearted, that's where I'd start.

A realistic question is, have I seen any benefits from this? Yes. My blood pressure is down. My resting heart rate is down somewhere in the mid 50's. My cholesterol is down, according to the cheap home test I did it's around 133. In general, I feel better and have plenty of energy. Oh yeah, I may have slimmed down a little too.

Now, I'll confess a couple things, and then be done:
<ul>
	<li>I'm not a doctor, never played on TV, and have no formal education in nutrition.  I like to read, and this is a subject I find interesting, so I am learning more about it every day.  If you have concerns, you should discuss them with a doctor or someone whom you trust and had knowledge of the subject.</li>
	<li>These are my opinions. Take them for what it's worth to you.</li>
	<li>My reasons for doing this are many, but mainly it's to improve the quality of my life. Part of my quality of life is spending time with my wife and children, and if they want to go to Costco and have a piece of pizza and ice cream for lunch once in a while, then that's what we're doing. I choose not to eat most it, but I go with them and we have a good time. Keeping the reasons you're doing this foremost in your thoughts, and it becomes a lot easier.</li>
	<li>That's also why above, it says I'm following a "mostly" plant based diet. A bit of something or another on occasion may happen, and I'm not going to stress out about it. The zealot's out there will say never do it that is off the plan, but everyone needs to makes their own choice.</li>
	<li>Those links above will take you to Amazon, so you can see exactly what books I'm reading.</li>
</ul>
I'd love to hear your opinions in the comments below.  Is this helpful? Do you want more information? Should I finish my book? Do you want recipes?
