A couple days ago (Saturday), I was sitting around talk to the wife after dinner. Originally, I wasn't planning on running, but as I was talking to hey, I mentioned that I've done 5 days in a row. Maybe I should just see how long I can keep it going. 

Of course, as we all know, I don't always run. sometimes I walk. Heck, I've even been known to skip on occassion. (But it's been at least 10 years). So, as my wife says, "I go out and pedestrian-ate." She said sounds like fun, so out the door I went to do a quick mile and a half. 

(Yes, in our family, it's perfectly acceptable to make up words as they are needed. After all, that's what makes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yinglish">Yinglish</a> so great.)

 So, on Sunday's long run (almost 10 miles), on day number 7, I gave it some more thought and decided to keep it going some more. I have my own goals I've set for when I'm planning on stopping, and hopefully I'll reach them as some point. (Otherwise, 50 years from now, I'm going to be really dang tired!)

Figure my rules are simple. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Must do over a mile</span>. Can be walking, as long as there are at least a few steps of running included to get the heartrate up.  Why a mile? Well, because that's what the <a href="http://runeveryday.com/">streakers</a> expect.  My official start date was Monday, August 4, 2008. I don't need any other rules. 

Today's mile was spent on a treadmill, watching Olympics, womens water polo. (Not something I've ever watched before.)  Day number 8. 

Cheers.

Follow-up note (15 minutes after originally posting this):  Oh, we talked, and figured I'd probably be better off with a stretching streak...so I'll try to stretch every day too.

And my funny story: During yesterday's run, a biker was coming up on me. He yelled to his buddy "Runner Up!". Not being quite on top of my game, I responded "yeah, I'm standing."  The better response, which I thought of as the second biker passed, was "I'm not the runner up. I'm the winner!"  Dang, I cracked myself up on that one.
