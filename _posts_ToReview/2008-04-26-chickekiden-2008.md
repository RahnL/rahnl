Last year, I heard about a run that sounded like a lot of fun, but for various reasons, I couldn't do it. However, this year I was determined to make it onto a team and do it. Today was this day! The 2008 <a href="http://www.lanierrunningclub.org/">ChickEkiden</a>, part of the <a href="http://www.chickencitycookoff.com/">Gainesville chicken festival</a>. It's a marathon length (26.2 miles) relay with a team of 6 people. The best part? The relay baton is a rubber chicken.

Our group was able to come up with 12 people, so we entered two teams: "<a href="http://www.runnersfit.com/">Runners Fit</a>" and "Runners Not So Fit". The "fit" team was made up of the fastest people, and the rest of us, who weren't so fast, were the other team. Needless to say, yours truly is not so fast...

Each of us had was responsible for approximately 4.3 miles. I was a little worried when Ryan told me the last mile was tough. Of course, I asked him if that meant it was his-tough or my-tough. It took him a moment to think about, but decided that it was his tough. Uh-oh, that doesn't bode well.

Starting off, there were a lot of big rolling hills. Running next to a lady, whom I ended up doing almost the whole leg with (Coach Carmen), we joked that if this wasn't considered the tough part, we need to really worry about the last mile!

Well, we ran. Without going through the boring step-by-step of the entire route, it was a good course. I actually didn't think the last mile was that bad at all. The thing that makes it tough is just that you're tired. Especially me, since I was like white lightning, running 2 minutes faster than my average. And yes, that's two minutes faster per mile! I finished my leg in 37:50, when I was planning for 45 minutes. WooHoo!

One thing that may have slowed me down just slightly is I did what was appropriate: At each mile marker, I had to slow down to do part of the chicken dance. And of course, after I did the handoff, I did it again.

A shout out goes to my wife who came out to take pictures and support us. (She acted as the "team mom" for us, although she drew the line at holding our used Kleenex.) The rest of the team was great to hang out with and we all got our fill of chicken jokes in.

And for the record, this race gets a big thumbs up! The course was good, a lot of support and volunteers. The post race food was good. (I'll let other people give their comments, but I liked the Panera breads.)

Afterwards, we planned on going to the chicken festival, but ended up shooting up to Brenau Academy, a girls school associated with the university there, where Dianna graduated from. We thought we'd take a picture of her there, but turned out they were having an open house. We ended up spending plenty of time talking to a lady who was touring it with her kids, and talked to the headmaster and a couple other people there. We also got to wander around and see the rooms and classes and stuff. It was a lot of fun.

We then stopped at <a href="http://www.runnersfit.com/">RunnersFit</a> for their spring sidewalk sale. Turns out that a number of people from our group was there, so we hung out a bit. (Felt sorta like going to Cheers, where everyone knows your name.) I met <a href="http://seedadrunrundadrun.blogspot.com/">David</a>, who ran the Sweet H2O 1/2 marathon this morning.
