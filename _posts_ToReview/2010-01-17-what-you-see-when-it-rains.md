Well, I was looking forward to some wet, muddy trail action today, but it didn't quite work out. Oh well...
I did head out the door for a trip around the neighborhood, and picking up the paper, what do I see?
A "cute" little guy...

I looked him right in the eye and told him I didn't want any insurance quotes.

(I think that's a great picture)

He was around 8 inches long. I moved him off to the bark and grass, and he took off, then so did I (for a few minutes of running).
