We recently returned from a family vacation to the Wyndham Great Smokies Lodge in Sevierville, TN. It was fun, and I could happily write paragraph after paragraph about the three days we spent going down water slides, playing in the wave pools, and getting lost in the arcade - but instead, let's talk about something else that's near and dear to my heart: <strong>Beans</strong>.

On the drive there, we passed the <a href="http://www.bushbeans.com/en_US/about_us/visitor_center/">Bush's Baked Bean</a> factory. It was Sunday, so the visitor's center was closed, but we decided we had to stop on our way back home.

We wondered what they would have: bean factory tours, bean tastings?Â Would we get a glimpse of the secret recipe?

No tours, tastings, or secret recipes - however, they did have a museum about the history of the company and a display about the canning process. They also have a gift shop and a cafe. We did not have time to eat at the cafe (although, we will plan to on a return trip). We did, however, buy my mother-in-law a gift basket of baked beans and my father-in-law some Bush's logo golf balls.

I love the "stick your head in" pictures, so we had to take our picture with Duke (the dog) and Jay. Inside the museum, there is a custom postcard booth, where you have your picture taken with a choice of backgrounds. (Note to self: Learn how to do green-screen pictures for party activities.)

There was a display showing the family cookbook. It was marked top secret, and had a laser security system, so risking the wrath of the guards that surely must have been watching from some hidden room, I didn't even dare take a picture. I guess I'll never know how their recipe compares to my not-so-secret recipe.

Overall, this was a fun break on our road trip. If you're passing through the region, I'd suggest a quick stop. Next time, we'll plan ahead and eat the restaurant.
