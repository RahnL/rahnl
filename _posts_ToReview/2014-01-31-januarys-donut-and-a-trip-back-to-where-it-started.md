Recently I went  to Los Angeles to celebrate my grandmother's 90th birthday.  It was just a quick trip, and besides spending time with family, there was two things I wanted to do:
<ol>
	<li>Get a run in the nice warm weather</li>
	<li>At the end of the run, stop at the donut shop on the corner for breakfast.</li>
</ol>
Since I've been talking about donuts lately, I thought a trip to the first donut shop I remember going to would be a fun trip back. They used to have a "big foot" donut that was huge. I loved getting it and eating the toes off, kinda like heads on gingerbread men. Unfortunately, the shop was gone, so no donut for me.

Luckily, my donut of the month arrived the day before I left, so I had one for the road.

This months flavor was Cookies and Cream.  I really wasn't sure what to expect, something like Oreos I suppose based on the looks of them.  And turns out, that's pretty much what they were.

Being that I was leaving, and didn't want to eat a whole dozen donuts before getting on a plane, I threw them in the fridge hoping they'd hold up.  Again, I was pleasantly surprised that they did last decently.

As for the run, I did a nice 6 miles around the Sepulveda dam.  Except for going up the dam, it was flat as a pancake and felt great.

About a mile in, I saw a group starting out, and I slowly caught up to them. It was a bunch of <del>kids</del> teenagers. Of course, I started talking.  Turns out they were from <a href="http://fcps-lausd-ca.schoolloop.com/groups/news_item?d=x&amp;id=1356616052486&amp;group_id=1315636519825&amp;return_url=1391219331746">Fulton College Prep High School</a>, and they had a marathon club! They were training for the Los Angeles marathon at the end of march.

The three kids I talked to, for two of them this was their second race. The other one was training for his first, and I think he was so focused, he didn't do more than grunt.  He probably didn't think we were funny talking about not being able to walk for 3 days after my first marathon.  Sorry, I couldn't help myself. :)

Good luck on your race!

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Bubbie (my grandmother) had a great weekend. </span>We had a great time hanging out, and spending the whole time overwhelming her with technology. (Ipad, Kindle, Facebook, Skype, Oh my!)

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">On Saturday, she gave an amazing speech during services.   The moral was to appreciate what you're given, and be sure to think for yourself. Great advice from a great lady.</span>

Happy Birthday!
