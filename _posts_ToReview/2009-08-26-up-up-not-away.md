I have a new workout on Tuesdays.  After last weeks stairs kicking my butt, figured it was time for some revenge. So, every Tuesday now, for the forseeable future, figure I'll do stairs.  There are 11 stairs per flight, 2 flights per floor, and if I counted correctly in my oxygen deprived brain, 31 flights from the basement to the 15th floor where I have to stop.

Plus, because it's bowling night, I might as well do legs, since I don't want to wear out my arms. (A 15lb ball gets heavy after 2 hours of throwing it around.)

This week, it took me 5:46 to get to the top. 10:54 was the total trip time.  I think it would be great to get down to 4 minutes, which I think is a reasonable goal to shoot for by the end of September/beginning of October.  Next week, I'll start heading up a second time after completing the lap.  I've been hopping on the stationary bike for 10 minutes, but the stairs again will do me more good.

Guess if I manage to keep it up, hills should become much easier.

Also, I've started another streak of sorts. I decided to see if I could get rid of most the high fructose corn syrup from my diet. I know this should be good for me, so lets see how it goes. The rule I'm starting with is if HFCS is in the top 5 ingredients, then it counts as having it for the day. (Alot of bread and other staples have it in there, but it's a ways down the ingredient list. Unless I want to cook everything I eat, it's going to be really hard to really eliminate it.)

I'm on day 3.

The sad part, no more donuts. :(

(I've been torn on whether to talk about dieting on this site. I think I should start a different blog for that, and keep this one about fun stuff. What do y'all think? If there is an overwhelming demand for it, I can post the stuff here. Likewise, if a bunch of people say "we don't care", then alas, I'll go to a different site to focus on that.)
