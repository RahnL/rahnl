Saturday, we did the <a href="http://www.fivestarntp.com/Valentine_Races.html">Great Valentines Race</a> in Cumming. It was a low key affair, with around a 140 participants.  The starting temperature was hovering just below freezing, and there was a bit of wind. Bundled up, we walked 99% of the race and we didn’t place, nor did we win any awards for costumes, but we did take a couple minutes off our time from the last race we ran, and had a good time.

Surprisingly, we were the only people there with a stroller. The little man was bundled up, having fun pointing at all the people and breaking out in random noises, making everyone around smile.  However, there was a big Subway sandwich running behind us, which was a first. (They were a sponsor.)

<a href="http://www.kirklands.com">Kirkland's</a> was at the finish line, and they had opened early in case anyone needed some home goods. Sounds silly, but it actually worked out well. Between the sale they were having, and the coupons he was giving out, we got a good deal on some picture frames that we had been thinking about. It looked like there were a number of other people in there buying things too. We talked to one lady for a while, whose son won the overall first place, about running with kids and how fast they grow up.

On the way home, we stopped at the <a href="http://www.thedineratsugarhill.com/">Diner at Sugar Hill</a> for brunch. The food was good and the service was fast. The waiters played with the little man, and he loved the extra attention, and looking at all the people.  The cakes in the display looked really good, but we didn’t try any.  The Belgium waffle and French toast were cooked just right, and hit the spot.

What I really enjoyed about the whole morning was spending time with my wife (and son, of course).  Last summer, she started walking with some friends, and really gotten into it. Heck, at one point, she was getting more miles per week than I was!  In doing so, she’s lost a lot of weight, and has become more motivated to do some racing.  I’m really proud of her.

We were talking on the way home, and couldn’t believe it when we realized the combined weight loss between the two of us since the beginning of 2010 is nearly 100 pounds!  Wow.  One of these days, I’ll have to start writing about that experience…
