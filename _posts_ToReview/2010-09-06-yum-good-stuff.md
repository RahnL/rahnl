You won't belive what happened the other day.  I went running, and  I took it easy... and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">slowed</span> to a nice 10 minute pace!  Yes, you read that right, I actually slowed down to just over 10 minutes per mile.  Considering that until the very recent past, that was a extreme speed up, this was quite a nice change.

Now, I just need to figure out how to keep it up for 25+ more miles at a time, and I should be ready for my next race.  Speaking of which, I'm at a bit of a dilemia.  It looks like I may have something going on at the end of March, so Georgia marathon might be out. I've been going back and forth about signing up for one of the <a href="http://getguts.com/e-grr.shtml">GRR</a> races that my friends at <a href="http://getguts.com/">GUTS</a> are putting on...but haven't quite committed yet.

The other thing going on is something that I should admit I indulged in.  Really, because I shouldn't have. Oh wait, I'm a man, let me re-state.  I pigged out the other day, and it was good.

About a block from the office, a <a href="http://gigiscupcakesusa.com/atlantabuckheadgeorgia">Gigi's Cupcakes</a> just opened.

For a week or so, I've been seeing flyer's (menu's) around the office, and my co-worker mentioned them a couple times as a place to try, so last Thursday, instead of going running, we walked up there. 

Walking in, it's a quaint little shop. The lady at the counter asked if we had any questions, so I asked the most important one:  Where are the samples?  She smiled, and looked at me like I was crazy...I don't know why, it seemed like a reasonable question to me.  At three bucks a pop, I want to make sure I'm going to get something good. 

Everything looked good...each cupcake was probably 4-5 inches tall, piled high with frosting and sprinkles and decorative stuff.  I like that they have a rotating menu, so they have some standard cakes, and then a different daily menu.  It's also going to change from summer to winter, so there should be a large variety.

I got a couple, and they survived the trip home intact.  One was the <a href="http://gigiscupcakesusa.com/caramelsugarmama">Caramel Sugar Mama</a>, and the other was a <a href="http://gigiscupcakesusa.com/midnightmagic">chocolate midnight magic</a>.

The cupcakes themself were good; fresh and not crumbly. Better than I've had at other local bakeries.  The frosting had a lot going on, in a good way.  There was a ton of if.  The consistancy of it reminded us of the Betty Crocker stuff you'd get at the grocery store, but it was better quality. There was definitely a bit of sugar in it.  Having one cupcake was plenty.  (And I don't say that lightly, I'm a man who likes to eat.)

Yes, they are a little expensive, but I think it's worth it. We'll be going back...the wife wants me to get some for a day with the girls.  And the guys at the office, well, we might just sneak over there occasionally with no-one the wiser.
