I was looking at the <a href="http://www.ajc.com">AJC online</a> the other day, and an add popped up for a <a href="http://sweetsurprise.com/">Sweet Surprise</a>. Thinking it had something to do with cookies, I clicked on the link. Lo and behold, it's a site put up arguing the case for high fructose corn syrup.

So, I thought I'd pass it on, and give my thoughts. (As y'all who've been keeping up, lately I've been trying to kick HFCS out of my diet.  I haven't intentionally had any for few weeks.) 

According to this site, there is nothing wrong with HFCS, and it's no different than using regular sugar. (Well, that's the gist of what they say.)  For the most part, I agree.  Although the caloric intake is approximately the same, I think the way it's processed makes it a little different.  How different? Beats me, but I figure it's been processed quite a bit, so that's probably done something to it.

One thing on the site I  thought was interesting was the myths.  They answered a bunch of questions about what people think about it, and whether the assumptions are true.  Citing a number of valid studies, they show that most the myths are false. (I say most, since I assume there are other ones out there that they did not address.)

I did appreciate learning the difference between HFCS and regular corn syrup.  (Corn syrup os used as a non sweetening thickener.)

Now, the number one reason I am trying to eliminate it from my diet is that I eat too much. Since this is essentially sugar, and I need to reduce my sugar intake, getting rid of the HFCS is the logical choice.  It is in almost everything I buy. (I'd guess 85% of products, but as we all know, 78% of all statistics are made up on the spot, and this one is no exception, so it's probably not a valid guess.)

They actually address the  fact that it's in everything, saying it makes everything take good and look pretty.  Well, it's sugar, so of course it does!

Well, hope this is helpful. I think I was going to write more, but my body is going into a sugar-withdrawal coma, and I can't remember. (Have gone all day with no sugar.  I need to start having sugar free days. And then start combining them into a sugar free week.  I bet it would be good for me. Painful, but good.)
