Wow, it's been hot!  Hot, hot, hot...Hotlanta. Yup, that's where we are.  Okay, enough whining.

A co-worker talked me into running the <a href="http://www.collinshilltfxc.net/">Dennis McCormick</a> 5K in a couple weeks.  (The check's in the mail.) Di looked the course, and after confirming it with the race director, it looks like it's pretty tough. The first half is downhill, and then you run back up it.  Whew!  I'm sweating just thinking about it.

It will be fun though, since I haven't run a 5k in years.  Plus, given that we're planning on Waffle House for breakfast afterwards.  :)

The distance will be just right for me, since right around 3 miles is what I've been doing lately. Been working on holding a sub 10 pace, and making progress.  This last weekend, ran into BethM right as we were both starting, and did a lap around LMP with her.  Although she said that I was wearing her out, I don't believe her, but we did do the 2.2 mile loop in 20:40.  For me, that's cruising!

Work has me doing a rapid job on a HIPAA translator for a specific transaction set. Joy...look for more soon. Also doing some web services, and HL7. (Yeah, I know...living on the edge.)
