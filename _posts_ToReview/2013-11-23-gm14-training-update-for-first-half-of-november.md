Two weeks into getting back to training, and things are going good.

For November 8th - 21st, I logged 26 miles and some change.
The two long runs for this period were 7.75 miles on trail that was more of a nice walk in the woods, and an 8 mile run on the treadmill to prove I could do that distance. :)

My speed isn't quite what I'd like, but I'm getting spurts of sub 9 minute miles in.

I also learned a couple new stretches.  One for a rotated pelvis, not an issue I have but I like the stretch.  The other(s) are for piriformis syndrome, which also seems to be doing good things for my legs.

For the second half of the month, I should get somewhere around 40 or so miles in.

Until next time, happy trails.
