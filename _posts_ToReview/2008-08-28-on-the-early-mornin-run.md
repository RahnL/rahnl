<p style="text-align: center;">On the early morning run, with my ipod in my hand.
With an aching in my legs, and a shoeful of sand...
I'm a long way from home, and only a couple more miles to go.

<p style="text-align: center;">Out during mile number 9, Asics laces and set to go
But I'm stuck here in the grass with a pain that evergrows
Now the gatorade tasted good, and the women all were fast
Well now there she goes my friend, she's beating me at least...

<p style="text-align: center;">This old track's got me down, it's no earth good to me
'Cause I'm stuck here with a cramp, as cold and stiff as I can be
You better jump  and go when you hear that big ol' gun,
So I'd best be on my way, on the early morning run.

 
<p style="text-align: left;">Ah, my apologies to <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=early+morning+rain+gordon+lightfoot">Gordon Lightfoot</a>. Sometimes this happens when I run early. (But for the record, it was not raining. It was actually a beautiful morning, with just a sliver for a moon. And no traffic.)</p>
