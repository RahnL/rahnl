As you know, we took a trip to Peru in May, 2013.

This all started as a casual comment when Dianna was out with her friend's, and one of them casually said something along the lines of "my husband has a business trip to Lima, so I'm going to site see.  Who wants to come with me?"

Dianna happily said "I want to", and a couple months later we were on our way.

It was an exciting vacation.  Hopefully the various photo journals from the trip have given you an idea of what we've seen.  We'd love to go back to see even more.

Our tours were organized by Ana Marie at <a href="http://imperialperu.net/home/default.htm">ImperialPeru.net</a>.  She did a great job organizing everything for us, and the tours we did were grand adventures. Carlos, her person in Cusco, did a great job with his people and we had a marvelous with time all the guides we had.  If you're looking for a travel agent, she is highly recommended.

As a side note, at one point I asked one of our guides how he knew so much about the area.  He had recently graduated from school with a degree in tourism.  In the US, that means you learn how run a hotel (or so I think), but there, it means you spend years learning about the local area and all the information needed to become a tour guide and answer every question that might be thrown at you.

Also, thanks to my sister-in-law, Vicki, for lending me her camera, a Canon T4i.  My camera would have been more than adequate, but hers was a bit sharper, and I while I didn't expect to use the video mode, it turns out that I was happy to have it because I did use it a few times.

Last, but not least in the series is some pictures from Machu Picchu.  We hope you enjoy them and much as we enjoyed taking them.
