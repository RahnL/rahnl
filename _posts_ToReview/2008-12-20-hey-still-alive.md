Wow, been a while since I put anything up...just been busy. Y'all know how that goes.

To catch y'all up:

- Hip injury: Fine.  At the end of my month off, ready to go.

- Toe injury: The day I was looking forward to starting to run again, I got a bad pain in my toe. Needless to say, excrutiating pain while walking put the road off for an extra week. So, my month turned into about five and a half weeks off.

- Toe is better-Heading out of town.  Yup, pretty much all better, but then we went to Florida for the weekend. No running there, but we took a couple interesting pictures. We took <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_19">US 19</a> at one point, as a scenic detour. Only after we got home did we look it up and realize it's one of the deadliest highways in the country. Guess we won't be going that way anymore.

- Okay, finally started running again. Yay. I felt good on a test run 3 weeks into my rest, but the extra couple weeks on that really seemed to kill my legs and lungs. Oh well...I'm taking the opportunity of rehab to work on building my speed. Figure at long as the legs need to get trained to run again, might as well try to speed them up. Today, I managed a blazing sub 9 minute mile. Needless to say, I was amazed...then I rapidly slowed down to slow and happy speeds.

- Races: I've decided to forgo the Jan 4th 50K. I was thinking of a end-of-Jan 40 miler, but I think this will have to wait until April. February's 50K is still on at this point, as is March's marathon.

- Facebook:  Jenny yelled at me during this mornings group run about not accepting her Facebook friend invitation. For the record, I check Facebook once or twice a month, so you need to have patience.  (Needless to say, I rapidly signed on and accepted her invite.  Hope I'm not in trouble any more.  My loving wife proceeded to laugh at me.)

Now you're all caught up. Time to relax, enjoy the holidays, and get plenty of rest.
