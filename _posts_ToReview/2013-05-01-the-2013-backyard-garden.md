Near the beginning of April, 2013, we planted our garden for the summer, hoping that all the frost had passed.  We had some close calls, with temperatures getting into the upper thirties, but everything seems to have survived and is growing well.

My 2013 backyard garden

On the list for this year:
<ul>
	<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">4 types of Tomatoes</span></li>
	<li>Several bell peppers</li>
	<li>Lemon Cucumbers</li>
	<li>Broccoli</li>
	<li>Spinach</li>
	<li>Cabbage</li>
	<li>Basil</li>
	<li>Lemon Thyme (still going from last year, even with my transplant to a large pop)</li>
	<li>Parsley</li>
</ul>
The adventure in planting this year was Max following right behind me, pulling up each plant as soon as I started putting the next one in.  He's also yanked a lot of random leave off, including the top half of one the bell peppers. Gardening with a 2-year-old is definitely a challenge.

We've already started harvesting spinach, which seems to be doing great.  I have to laugh when I bring Isaac out to hold the basket while I cut leaves and put them in. Then by the time we make it back inside after playing a for a bit, it's all gone because he ate it all.  While I wish we had enough for everyone to have some, the fact that my 4-year-old wants to pig out on spinach makes it kind of hard to complain.   Luckily, it's growing fast enough that we can pick more every couple of days.

We had a wild hair and are trying both broccoli and cabbage.  I'm not sure how well they are going to do, but it's been fun to watch.

Most of the cabbage isn't growing much, but it's not dying either.   One looks like a head is forming.   It's a 45-55 day growing cycle, so we have a few more weeks to wait to see how it's going to turn out.

This year, I wanted to actually watch how long things to grow, to see if it's accurate to what the packaging says.  We are considering everything planted on April 1st, even through it's give or take a couple of days.

The next thing to wait for growing is all the grass, so you don't see all the dirt. :)

And now to cleanse our pallets with some parsley.
