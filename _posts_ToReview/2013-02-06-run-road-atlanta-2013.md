<a href="http://gonesomewhere.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Rahns-1st-place-finish-Road-Atlanta-2013.jpg"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-1181" alt="Engraved bamboo coaster as trophy" src="http://gonesomewhere.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Rahns-1st-place-finish-Road-Atlanta-2013-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></a>I ran Road Atlanta this morning, both the 5K and 10K races. I like the race <a title="Run Road Atlanta 2012" href="http://gonesomewhere.com/2012/01/run-road-atlanta-2012/">last year</a>, and this year didn't disappoint. It's a tough course with almost nothing flat on it, but it's on a race track! (Which just got bought out by Nascar, so IÂ heard.)

Amazingly, I finished first in my age group for the 10K.
I didn't place in the 5K, but that's okay.

Just wanted to share, as I enjoy my winners coaster. Next year, I need to win masters or overall...the trophies were engraved cutting boards. Something a bit different, I thought it was cool.
