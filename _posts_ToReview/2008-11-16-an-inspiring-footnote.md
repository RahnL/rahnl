One thing I meant to mention in the <a href="http://www.gonesomewhere.com/?p=282">Pinhoti 100</a> results, but started to run out of room:

While waiting around aid station 18, one of the first few guys (well, someone in the top 5 or 10, I wasn't counting) came running in wearing pajama bottoms and a heavy flannel shirt. After I stopped chuckling at his looks, and helped him find his drop bag, we exchanged a few words.

Apparently, he stopped at one of the last few aid stations where someone had an RV, and took a 3 hour nap. They gave him the clothes he was wearing to help keep warm. Cracked me up, I wish I would have had my camera handy.

Well, after he was sitting, I looked over and he was checking his blood sugar. I asked, and turns out he is diabetic. To me, this is extremely motivational, since this isn't the type of sport you'd expect to see diabetics in. Besides being very tough, and needing to maintain track of sugar levels, which is tough enough, I'd also worry about all the potential foot injuries.

So dude, whoever and whereever you are, good job and thanks for the motivation.
