A week or so ago, while Dianna headed out the door, she said "be sure to send me status updates on how it's going."  That whole evening, we had a good time, and every once in a while, Isaac (almost 6 now) or Max (just turned 4) would say to send mommy a new update. Using the fancy speech to text engine on my phone, we'd send a status text. Since the translation wasn't always perfect, it provided us of hours of fun for the night.

Today, Dianna was working the whole day, so I thought it would be fun to document the whole day:

7:30ish AM: Everyone has breakfast, all is well. A load of laundry is in the machine. While handing Isaac his glasses, decided to teach him how to clean them himself. Seems like a good idea he learns to do this eventually.

7:58: Dianna leaves, kids are happily playing. Ahh, I'm going to enjoy a cup of coffee.

8:45: Everyone is still happy.  Head upstairs to swap laundry and get some supplies for a project for the day. Because the weather's going to be bad, I wanted to setup a green screen so the boys could do a weather report while watching the radar images on the computer.

I come down and start hanging the piece of felt I found. "Come here boys, lets take a couple pictures."

"Okay, I need both of you. Okay, look at me and say cheese. Max, look at me. Max, where am I? Can you look at me? Me, not your toy.  No really, it's daddy talking, not the lego's. Look in the direction of the sound. Can you hear me? Isaac, keep holding that pose, you look great. Can you get Max to look? No? Okay Max, don't look at me. Look at the camera. Hey Isaac, where are your glasses...Max, keep looking. Cheese..."

A few pictures later...

9:03: Okay boys, thanks for the pictures. Back to playing.

9:04: "Isaac, where are your glasses?" "I don't know." "Uh, can you look for them?"

905: "Okay daddy, I don't see them. Can we watch a movie?"  "No, we can't watch a movie. Without your glasses, you wouldn't be able to see it."

9:06: Both boys in unison, "Can we watch a movie now?"  "Did you find your glasses? No, well, I guess you need to keep looking."

9:18: Been looking everywhere, glasses are nowhere to be found. Isaac is getting upset. "Daddy, they're gone forever!!!"  "No Isaac, they're somewhere."

"I must have left them at school?"  "Isaac, did you go to school today?"  "No." "Well, I'm pretty sure you didn't leave them there."  I wander off to look in some other places while he is distraught in the other room, and Max is happily ignoring it all.

"Daddy, I'll wear my backup glasses," Isaac says, wandering in wearing his backup ones. "Good idea Isaac! Now you should be able to see really good, exactly where you left them."  We keep looking.

9:33:  "Can we watch a movie now?  I have my backup glasses still on and can see really well.."  "No Isaac, because if you lose those ones, you won't have backups anymore. Lets keep looking."

Hey, you boys were in the restroom. Lets look in there...Isaac looks and states "not in here. We've looking everywhere!" (For about the 10th time.)  Ah, it hits me and I can't resist. "Hey Isaac, did you flush them down the toilet?"

10 minutes later of "They're gone forever! I flushed them down the toilet. The fish will use them and not give them back.  Ohhhhh, it's horrible!  Can we please watch a movie now? It's the only thing that's going to make me feel better."

9:49: Heck, I'm tired of listening to it. I'll do a movie and be able to look for the glasses in peace and quiet.  We put on Penguins of Madagascar.

10:00: Everyone is happy. It's quiet. I head up to swap laundry again. I guess the glasses are in the wash, but they're not.  Oh wait, there they are on Max's shelf. Wonder when he brought them up here. "Hey dude, good news! Your glasses weren't flushed."

Movie is good.  The rest of the morning is spent randomly yelling "DAVE!" because he's the bad guy in it, and Max likes saying it.

10:36: "Daddy, I'm hungry."  I give both boys a banana.

10:38: "Daddy, I'm still hungry." I give both boys some cashews.

10:46: "Daddy, I'm still hungry."  Hmmm...there's some left over chicken nuggets.  Here boys...

10:52: "Daddy, I'm still really hungry." Okay, here are some oyster crackers and some raisins.

10:58: "Daddy, still hungry." "Sorry boys, there's no food in the house left." "You mean except for oyster crackers and raisins?"  "Yes, I stand corrected. The only food we have in the house is oyster crackers and raisins."

11:30 or so: We go to Aldi to do some shopping.

After Aldi, we go to McDonalds so they can play in the playground. Not wanting anything to eat there, I get some side salads. We eat, and as expected, Isaac steals one of my salads (which is why I order 2 of them.) Max is happily playing with his new fire breathing monster toy.  We stay for an hour or so while they run around, and I ruin my eyesight by trying to read about school programs on my phone.

2:30: We get home. Max is cranky, and both kids are asking can we watch a movie and have "Ipad time". "Okay, Max, you're going to hang out on my lap and fall asleep while we watch a How It's Made."

3:00:  Hmm, Max is still awake, but I dozed. My neck is really sore now, but hey, we had a 1/2 hour of quiet. I guess it was worth it!  Managed to take Max up and he went to sleep in his bed.

I go to unpack the groceries. Wow, we sure have a lot of crackers, pretzels and chips now. For some OCD type reason, I think we always need these staples when we go to Aldi's.  Well, at least now we have more than oyster crackers and raisins. And these will hold up well, so after the zombies take over, and the survivors are raiding old houses, they'll find something to eat at mine that should still be somewhat edible. Suppose I should have bought some twinkies and ding-dongs to really hook those guys up.  Since we don't have anything for dinner, maybe we'll go back out to the store later and get some.

2019-08-01 Edit:  Hey, the story never ended!  Did we survive? Are the zombies survivors well fed?  Dang...we may never know.  Oh wait, I'm typing this. And Isaac has gone through several pairs of glasses since then.
