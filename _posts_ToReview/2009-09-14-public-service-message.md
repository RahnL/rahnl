Howdy all. 

I got this message from my friends Jennifer and Lane, so forwarding it on in case you're in need of some fabric for your home decorating needs.  (And for those of you not familiar with Team Vogel, they are a husband/wife team of ultra runners and triathletes and really nice people.  I've met and talked to them a number of times at some GUTS events. Just don't ask Jen to run a mile long loop for 8 hours in August. She gets bored.)

Hello Everyone,
As you all know, I had a LOT of time (27 hours to be exact)  to think about Sister Mary Beth's "Running for a purpose" speech this past weekend while I ran (walked mostly) the 100 miler at the Grand Tetons.

Lane and I are reaching out to all runners/ athletes we know with blogs/Twitter/ Facebook pages, etc.
From 9/14 to 9/20 we are donating 10% of all sales from <a href="http://www.thetextilemill.com">www.thetextilemill.com</a> to Sister Mary Beth and her charity, <a href="http://aidsorphansrising.org/">Aids Orphan Rising</a>. 
<a href="http://www.Thetextilemill.com">Thetextilemill.com</a>  is Lane's online fabric store. We sell fabric for home decorating use such as reupholstering chairs and couches as well as  creating window treatments and bedding. We ship worldwide. We would love for you to help spread the word and hopefully we can raise some money for Aids Orphans Rising. 

 Thanks you so much,
Jennifer
