Greetings campers. Hope y'all are doing well.

Figured it was time to update you on whats going on, what will be happening, and what-nots.

First off, as I alluded to before, we just adopted beautiful twins. Please welcome Eliana and her little brother Isaac to the world.  They were born May 10, and we were there for all that excitement. (Well, My wife was. I was in the recovery room, with the camera and the important job of hitting the button on the baby warmer machine. I took it very serious, and the nurses were suitable impressed. Yes, I can press the little red button when the alarm sounds with the best of them.)

Ah, life is good...

Sincethen has been hectic. Sure, with two babies, you'd expect it to by.  But this was further complicated by the fact that they found a heart murmur in Eliana. Investigation found some very serious congenital heart defects and other assorted issues.

She had open heart surgery when she was 5 days old.  This has stabilized her, and in a few months when she's bigger, she'll go back for the more intensive reconstruction surgery.

After a few weeks of shuffling back and forth between the hospital and hotel we were staying (the adoption was out of town), Isaac and I came home last weekend.  This weekend, Eliana and my wife will fly home. (She's being discharged from the hospital at the end of the week.)

The hard part now will be keeping her away from people for a few months while she heals. After heart surgery, you need to be careful to stay away from any potential illness, since your body is weak and needs to recover.  So, if you see me showing up places with only Isaac for a while, that's why.  (It's also why we'll be really anal about making everyone wash their hands before playing.)

Isaac is in good shape and can't wait to get out there in the jogging stroller.  (I'll assume she can't wait either, but since she hasn't actually seen the stroller yet, it's hard to say.)

And hey, the girl next door that wants to help babysit just ran her first 5K. I think that means she's ready to take care of the baby and be corrupted by the running folks out there.  Maybe a 1/2 marathon to celebrate her 13th birthday...
