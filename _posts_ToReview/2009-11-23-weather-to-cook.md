Yup, fall is here. It's cold and rainy. There's some bite in the air.  Yup, just about perfect out for a jaunt in the woods.  If only I weren't nursing my ankle.

(But hey! I did work out today.  I now remember that push ups and situps suck...I need to do more.)

This weekend, we tried a new recipe, and it came out good, so in lieu of saying anything of worth, I figured I'd share.  If you don't like cauliflower, this is still good. (We're not the biggest fans of it just steamed.)
<ul>
	<li>Head of cauliflower</li>
	<li>1/2 onion</li>
	<li>Garlic</li>
	<li>3-4 tablespoons butter or margarine</li>
	<li>milk or soy milk</li>
</ul>
<ol>
	<li>Chop up the cauliflower and steam until really soft.  (10-12 minutes in the microwave should about do it.)</li>
	<li>While it's steaming, dice the onion.</li>
	<li>Sautee the onion in some of the butter. Add the garlic and continue the sautee until onions are soft.</li>
	<li>when the cauliflower is done, drain any water from steaming, if any.</li>
	<li>throw in the pan and saute with the onion/garlic until well mixed/flavored.  Add salt and pepper if desired.</li>
	<li>Throw it all in the food processor.</li>
	<li>Add rest of butter and blend well.  Add milk as needed to make it smoother.</li>
</ol>
Yummy!  Good replacement for mashed potato!
