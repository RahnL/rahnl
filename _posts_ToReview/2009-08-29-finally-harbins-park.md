Ever since it opened in March, I've been wanting to get to <a href="http://www.gwinnettcounty.com/cgi-bin/gwincty/egov/ep/gcNavView.do?BV_UseBVCookie=yes&amp;path=Departments|Community+Services|Parks+%26+Recreation|Our+Parks+%26+Facilities|Guide+to+Your+Parks|Harbins+Park">Harbins Park</a> to check out the trails. The trip was worth it. Wish I could have gotten their sooner.

There is a hiking trail, horse trail, mountain biking trail, and some random paved trails.

I met up with <a href="http://seedadrunrundadrun.blogspot.com">David Ray</a>, Whit and Beth, and we did the hiking trail, which came out to just over 5.5 miles from the parking lot and back. There is about a 1/3 mile of pavement to cover to get to the trail, but that's no big deal.  The trail was well groomed and nothing technical. There is a bridge that's probably a 100 feet long that goes over an impressive chunk of granite.  There was mild hills throughout the whole thing.

David is great to run with, and we were together for the first couple miles (and Whit, Beth ran together) and he was more than happy to go reeeeeaaallllyyyy ssssllloooowwww at my pace.  He's very encouraging, and stressed that I shouldn't try to do too much with a infant in the house, since I'll be busy for a while.  But then, we talked about races and things coming up, and the usual junk one talks about while out enjoying the morning.  (And the weather was really nice too, cool for August.)

Whit hung out with me for a while, then everyone spend up as my leg started spasming and I had to slow to [even slower] walk.  No big deal, since I brought my camera and took some pictures.

We ran across a turtle crossing the trail, and Whit gave him a pep talk to help him on his way.

I got in around 5.5 miles in 1:25.  The first half was good, but I slowed down a lot in the last couple miles, but I'm happy with the distance and time.

The park was the HQ for a bike race. After David and Beth headed out for another lap, and Whit headed home to fresh made biscuits, I hung out to try to work on some action photograph things I wanted to try.  Didn't really work the way I wanted, but that's okay.  Still got a decent picture in.

Beth laughed at me coming up a hill. It must have been at least a 3 foot elevation change.

This is the almost the blurry effect I was trying to capture today. Didn&#39; quite work.

Someone left their bath scrunchy laying around.

Some mushrooms

A mushroom. It was probably 6 inches in diameter.

This kid was cruising along pretty good. A lot of determination in that face.
