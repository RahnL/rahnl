Ah, remember old times?  As you'll recall, last year I was sidelined for a month (around October/November) due to a hip issue. Then, soon as I started going again, I hurt my ankle. That gets better, then my toe went.  All in all, it was probably a month and a half off.  It wasn't all bad, I got some physical therapy in, and learned some good stretches and exercises in the process.

It may have slowed me down (as if I had any speed to start with), but I was still able to successfully run Hogpen Hill Climb (roughly equivalent of a half merry) in January, Black Warrior 50K in February, and the ING GA marathon in March.  Not too shabby

Looks like the yearly cycle is starting over.

Last weekend, Isaac and I went out for a stroll for a couple miles. Oh, it was hilly and relatively hard, but felt pretty good. Sunday found me doing stuff around the house and noticing my ankle was a little tight. By Monday, I couldn't move my right foot.  Needless to say, I've taken the week off.  I even had to skip bowling!

My hip flexor from last year has also been acting up again, but at least now I know what it is and how to deal with it.

So, now I'm starting the slow rehab.  I think I'll try doing more weight and core development than I've been doing.  I know some pushups and situps would be good for me, so I'll try to get more in. (And an improvement from doing 1 pushup a month shouldn't be too hard. :)

The good news is that I now have a real nice workout area at home with a comfortable firm foam mat, and a workout partner.  As an added bonus, I think my reading skills might improve too.
