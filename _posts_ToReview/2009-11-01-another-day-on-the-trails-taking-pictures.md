Saturday (Oct 31) was the annual Pumpkin Butt 50K fun run at Kennesaw Mountain. Since I didn't have all day to be out there, I went to take pictures and get a few casual miles in. (Probably 7-10 miles.)

Carpooling with Whit, we had some kinda funny misadventures of trying to get there. Lets just summarize with wrong time zones on alarm clocks, dead car batteries, and construction detours.  We did manage to get there right as everyone was leaving, which worked for Whit so she had someone to follow.

It was cool, windy, and raining as I headed out with the camera securely packed in a zip lock bad. Heading up Little Kennesaw, I met some local hikers who all knew each other.  The lady I was walking with (carrying a very bright umbrella) seemed to know everyone we passed, and stopped to chat with them all. Showing that it's a small world, turns out she works at one of the local hospitals. So, since I work with them too (as a vendor), I mentioned a couple of the people I knew, and turns out she knows one of them.  How about that--a complete stranger, and turns out on there was only 2 degrees of separation.

Not wanting to miss some "artistic opportunity", I took a few shots of the civil war cannons at the  top of Little Kennesaw. You can get an idea of what the weather was like.

As I made it to the top of Kennesaw, the lead runners were just starting to come the other way. Since it was still raining decently, I skipped some pictures. But I did get to see some of the costumes people were wearing.

A few minutes later, the rain mostly stopped, and I started shooting.  It also warmed up slightly,I'd guess the low 60's, so it wasn't too uncomfortable.  I started heading back down the mountain.

The rain started up again, and although I figured everyone would laugh at me, I pulled out my umbrella. I figure that was the best way to keep the water off my camera, and in general, it did work pretty well.

Heading down Pideon Hill, I was stopped in my tracks with one of the strangest things I've seen in a while: Monster Trucks.  But no ordinary trucks.  Take a look.

Yup. You're seeing right. There was a group of 6 or 7 radio control trucks heading up the mountain. Their drivers were taking things very seriously, but I couldn't stop laughing. After asking, they were planning on going as far up the mountain as they could. One guy mentioned having 3 extra batteries, so he had hopes of going quite a ways. From what I heard later, they were still going strong an hour after I saw them.

(On a side note: a bonus to putting on Facebook is that other people help tag them.  Thanks David!)
