# The Adventure
Two night campout at Camp Rainey Mountain (CRM), one of the Northeastern Georgia Boy Scout council's campgroup.


# Memorable Moments
- We did a map/compass/range finding team challenge where we split into several teams and raced around camp getting answers to questions. (Such as 'how high is the tallest flagpole? and 'whats the distance from the flagpole in front of the admin bulding to the plaque rock?')
- The lake was drained, so we explored the mostly empty lakebed. Everyone was given very specific instructions of where they were allowed to go and to stay out of the mud.
- having to rescue an individual who did not stay out of the mud and whose feet got stuck!
