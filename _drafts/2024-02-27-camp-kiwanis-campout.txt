#The Adventure
Stayed two nights at <A href='https://bgcma.org/local-clubs/campkiwanis/'>Camp Kiwanis</A>, the summer camp for the Atlanta area boys and girls club.  

This is a yearly campout we do, and perform a couple hours of service helping around the camp.  This year we spread mulch and cleaned up downed branchs.

# Memorable Moments
- Backpack trip to test out packs in preparation for an upcoming trip.
- Forgetting to pack a knife for the food, so having to make-do with a pocket knife and some people worried about it not being clean enough.
- Our senior scout for the weekend making all the scouts make random sounds for their dessert.  "Make a fish sound!  "Make a starfish sound".
- It was warm during the day but below freezing at night.  We mostly all managed to stay warm.
- Archery

# The Food
Amazing venison chili, corn bread and peach cobbler
