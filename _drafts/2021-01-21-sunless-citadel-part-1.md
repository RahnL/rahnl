Today the D&D group I've been working on organizing started it's first adventure.  True, we met last week and screwed around, but it wasn't playing.  Today was down and dirty roll playing, from interviewing townfolk to see what's going on and speaking in Elvish so we can have private conversations about how to make some gold off the mayor!  Oh, it was a good start.

The party consists of:
* Reinn, female elf rogue with a eye for venegance
* Aojek Otrobod, male elf fighter who loves to bake and goes by the nickname Chef
* Galador Satask, male elf wizard, whose back story is still to be shared

# The Adventure: The Sunless Citadel
The characters approached the village of Oakhurst in mid-winter, about a week before the solistice.  After taking a quick look at the well in the center of town, they went to the inn for lunch and gossip. There, they met the inn keeper, Garon, and his wife, Miriam.  Miriam started talking about some troubles over the last few months where people have been dying or being killed by some unknown entity.  Garon mentioned some problems too, and they both mentioned the goblins at The Sunless Citadel, a few hours up the road. After further discussion, the party headed over to talk to the mayor.

Meeting the mayor, after some discussion (and possibly a thinly concealled threat), an agreement was reached where the party would investigate the deaths and try to stop whatever was happening if they found a cause. 

They then departed to talk to the family of one of the people who died.  On approached, the party offered any help the family might need, so they ended up helping repair the roof of the house after investigating the scene of the death a couple months ago.  Nothing was noticed except the family remembered there being some dead shrubs about the body, which was strange.   After staying the night in the barn, and sneaking a sheep out in the middle of the night to see if anything ate it, they party left the next morning.  

Next time, will they proceed to talk to other families?  Or will something else come up? Maybe they'll stop and talk to othe people in town...

# DM Notes

While preparing for this, I had a last minute mind change and decided to run The Sunless Citadel for the first adventure, instead of a very long campaign in the temple of elemental evil.  Hoping to get to that down the road, but we'll see how this goes.  It's a lot of work to convert an old 1st edition game to 5th addition, whiile trying to learn how to use Roll20 and reread all the books that I haven't read in 30ish years.  But I'm slowing becoming proficient.  At least all the players now have icons for their characters and the first few macros they need to roll initiative and perception.

From the start, all characters start with a curse of random phantom sleep. (AKA narcolepsy of a sort.) The characters may randomly fall into a trance that causes them to turn wraith-like and unresponsive. They will follow the party around, but not participate any anything until they way up.  Galador was fell to this this week, and we will see how he recovers next time.  From a DM/Player perspective, we're all adults and sometimes have responsibilities that mean we miss a session.  This gives the ability for the character to rejoin an adventure in play, without having to sit out until there is a convenient place for them to pop up or the party reconvenes at the local inn.  I thought it was a pretty good idea, but we'll see how it works out.
