**Galador** Galador - Elf, level 1 _ABSENT_

**Ophae** Elf Rogue, level 1. +ABSENT_ Unknown if will return to game


## Strong Start

The party left off meeting a Kobold, Meepo.  He took them to meet the chiefton.  The chief offered a reward if the parties returned the clan's dragon. He offered Meepo to lead the way to where the goblins live.
The party left off at the entrance to the goblin, shortcut.  But they decided to go into another room instead of the shortcut.  This is the first door in the dungeon that they didnt check for traps, and also the first one that had a trap associated it.  Failing to detect the trap, but successfulling making their saves, they avoided getting splashed (and poisoned) by a pot of offal and dragon dung.

What's going to jump out the door...
