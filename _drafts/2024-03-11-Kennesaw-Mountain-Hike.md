# The Adventure
Our troop was supposed to do a overnight backpacking trip over the weekend, but due to getting over 6 inches of rain, we changed to do a day hike at <A href='https://www.nps.gov/kemo/index.htm'>Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park</A>.


Total hike was just over 5 miles and between Kennesaw and Little Kennesaw we got over a 1000 ft of elevation gain.

# Memorable Moments
- Learning about the different types of cannons, and where they are made, how much they weigh and where they are made.  (It's all imprinted on the cannon barrels.)
- Watching the movie about the battle was very interesting. 
- Learning that the greenspaces in the park are battlefields, and hence playing on them (and doing other recreational activities) is prohibited.  Apparently this is a hot debate topic, since being a battlefield people have died on those grounds but others want to enjoy the greenspace like at every other park
